# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis:
### Deliverable 1
The School District Analysis focuses on using Jupyter Notebook to examine, manipulate, and edit data using the pandas library. In the code, data from a school district is manipulated using conditional statements, comparison and logial operators, and the ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School was taken out and replaced with NaN. We import Pandas NumPy module, which is used to change the reading and math scores in our data to NaN.
### Deliverable 2
In the next part of the module challenge, we create a disctrict summary, school summary, a top five and bottom five performing schools, average math score for each grade level, average reading score for each grade level, and the scores by school per student spending, school size, and school type. After creating the summary, we will substract the ninth-grade students in Thomas High School from total student count, then recalculate teh passing math and passing reading percentages, overall passing percentage. Then we would calculate the number of 10th-12th graders in Thomas High School and replace the % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing scores for Thomas High School.
## Results
* The district summary is affected by changing the % Passing Math to 74.8%, % Passing Reading to 85.7%, % Overall Passing to 64.9%.

* The school summary is affected by changing the % Passing Math to 66.9%, % Passing Reading to 69.6%, % Overall Passing to 65.0%.

* When we replace the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools % Passing Reading, % Passing Math, and % Overall Passing higher than all other schools except for Cabrera High School.
* Replacing the ninth-grade scores are affect:

Math and reading scores by grade - Increasing to 93.3% % Passing Reading, 97.3% % Passing Math.
Scores by school spending - $630 - $644 per student.
Scores by school size - Medium (1000-2000) still medium school.
Scores by school type - Charter makes it the top 2 schools.
## Summary
### Four Major Changes After Updated School District Analysis
* % Passing Math grade changed to 97.3%
* % Passing Reading grade changed to 93.3%.
* % Overall passing changed to 90.9%.
* Thomas High School became the second highest school based off % overall passing.
